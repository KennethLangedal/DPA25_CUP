    Here, you should write your parallel implementation of
    a sorting algorithm of your choosing. The input array A
    should be sorted in ascending order after the function
    finishes. The second argument n gives the length of the
    array A. Note that the elements being sorted are
    unsigned 64-bit integers.

    Feel free to take a look inside the main.c file to
    understand what is going on. However, you should only
    hand in this file.
