# The Distributed and Parallel Algorithms Implementation Challenge

This repository will be updated with all the optional exercises and results. The current standings will also stay updated on this front page. See the readme in each folder for results on a particular exercise.

The scoring system we use works as follows. On each exercise, the submissions are sorted based on parallel running time. The fastest submission will score 20 points, the second fastest 19, and so on down to one. The only exception to this rule is the first exercise, where the points scored are multiplied by $0.5$. Otherwise, the points from each exercise are accumulated to determine the winning team. Note that the **two** best teams will win Algorithm Engineering coffee cups.
